My name is Tieanna Graphenreed and I am a second-year PhD student in Writing & Rhetoric at Northeastern University. 

This GitHub site will be adapted from my previous professional website. I'll be using this hybrid site as a more casual version of my academic work. It will feature blog posts and takeaways as I continue my digital projects.  

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more information head over to the [my personal website](https://tgraphenreed5.wixsite.com/tieannagraphenreed) on Wix.

This site structure is forked from Barry Clark's repository. Thank you to Barry Clark for sharing your work!
